# Fivem-Acid-Trip
Reworked Acid Trip - Original - https://github.com/meta-hub/fivem-acidtrip


--------------------------------

I've taken the original Fivem-Acid-Trip and modified it for better performance.

This script allows you to make acid a consumable item. I've included the small resources events needed to make the item usable, and the event to start the trip.

This DOES NOT spawn another entity of yourself and chase you, I noticed that code can be very buggy.

No longer experience random screen blackouts due to screen shake and other visual effects being too high.

Spawns 2 Marios around you.

--------------------------------

The trip last a total of 4mins. This can be changed.
